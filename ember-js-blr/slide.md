How did I end up using ember?

- Games in College (With C)
- Desktop Applications in College (C# .Net)
- Jan'12 Backend (at Tataatsu)
- iOS Development (I loved the philosopies behind Cocoa framework. )
- Which lead to Frontend Development (Vanilla JS at first and then I was recommended Backbone)
- Started researching about Front-end development
- Came across SproutCore that was used By Apple (Apple was a main contributor to SC)
- SC was forked as SC2.0
- SC2.0 later became Ember


Things that I love (and don't) about Ember.

- I really liked ember because
- Extremely Opinionated (Hated at first, and then I grew up - absolutely loved it! And then I grew up a little more - I just think its nice to have)
- Unlike Angular(Google) and React(Facebook) its not backed / controlled by a corporate. I like that
- Gradual upgrade and clearly planned roadmap
- Deprecation warnings
- 2-way bindings. Components. Addons. Properties and Observers
- ember-cli. ES6 Transpilers. Scaffolding. Inspector. Testing
- Rarely errors don't give a useful trace back [Sometimes this makes me frustrated]
- Rarely I get confused where to put a piece of code (Routes? Controllers? Views)
- Rarely does not work. No page getting rendered. No Errors. Nothing. Just a blank page
- A small error might break the whole application
- Puts restrictions on what we want to have (Design wise)


What did I learnt using Ember? And what should we do next?

- Opinionated = Mostly Good (Pure Evil when its not :P)
- Few libraries (Doesn't have library as much as it should have. So we should open-source everything we can)
- How to build a decoupled app
- When to be pragmatic? And when its okay not to?


Ember @ Appknox

- Built with Ember 1.11 (Looking to upgrade to 2.5 once its out). But Why?
- Emblem templating
- CoffeeScript (Looking to re-write in EmberScipt)
- Looking into building Desktop Application (With Github's Electon) with a shared (hopefully same) code-base.
- Deployed to S3.
- We will open-source a lot of our code during March/April this year.
